# 2SFCA-in-R @UZH Giuz
Two step floating catchment area method implementation in R code.

This code provides an example of 2SFCA implementation in R, including building a network dataset and routing algorithm. 
All the data necessary for the code to run is included in the repo, take note to adjust the read targets in your code.

The code was developed for intents of education and you are free to use it in your work, you can reference this github.

I wrote this code in a short ammount of time implementing in R the workflow that was otherwise done in ArcMap hence the code is not necessarily elegant or optimal, but it will work.

If you have any suggestions or are aware of new R packages which can expedite aspects such as the 2fa or routing, let me know!
